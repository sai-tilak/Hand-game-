Step 1 – Importing the necessary modules.
We make use of a few modules while building the game. Let me introduce you to them one after another.
1. Random Module : It is a built-in module used to generate random objects be it integers, floating-point numbers, or other objects.
2. Getpass module: Getpass module is typically used to get passwords from the users but in the game, the same is used to hide the input of player 1 from player 2 for a fair game.
 import random
 import getpass
 Step 2 – Printing Greeting Messages and asking the player about how it wants to play the game.
It is advisable for a game builder to greet the player before the game begins. 
Better greeting messages makes your game better than the other developers of the same game. 
After greeting the player is asked if it wants to play with the computer or a friend or wants to simply exit the game.
Step 3 – Creating the separate functions for various purposes.
Now a major step in building the game is defining the required functions for the proper working of the game. Let us build all the projects from the scratch.
